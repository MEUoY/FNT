Î³-rays from the first and second excited states of stable nuclides.

The graph was produced by M. Eslami, University of York

Level energies were extracted from the NuDat database of National Nuclear Data Center, https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat/

List of the stable nuclides and their percent natural abundance were taken from the 1997 report of the IUPAC Subcommittee for Isotopic Abundance Measurements.
